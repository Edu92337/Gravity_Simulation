# Gravity_Simulation  

## Description  
Gravity_Simulation is a 2D physics simulation built with Pygame. It simulates the motion of particles affected by gravitational forces, collisions, and boundary interactions within a confined space. The particles change color upon colliding with the screen boundaries.  

## Features  
- Gravity simulation with particles attracted to the mouse cursor.  
- Leapfrog integration for accurate motion calculation.  
- Realistic elastic collisions between particles.  
- Boundary interactions with color changes on impact.  
- Random initial positions, velocities, and colors for particles.
